# The 3D Printed Keyboard Key Project
This is a project I made back in high school, April 2014. My dad had lost one of the most valuable keys on his keyboard. The number one key. So I decided to create a new one for him using my school's 3D printer.

# Tools used
* **Autodesk Inventor** - Used to create the 3D model of the key.
* **Adobe InDesign** - To create the assisting PDF document needed to the school assignment.

# The Build Process
I started by looking at one similar key from the same keyboard. After a while, I had created a very close copy of the key in from of me in Autodesk Inventor. After a little help from my teacher and a day or two, waiting for me to get to the top of the printers waiting list, I got access to the schools 3D printer and started printing. 2 hours later, I had the key in my hand and pressed it into the keyboard. It didn't fit perfecly but it was way above usable. Later that day my dad got his keyboard back and could use it again. Holy shit, this was a boring story! But it was a fun project and I remember that I felt like it was nice to have created something that aculaty was going to get used. It might not have looked beautiful but it worked.
